* H_combined is now completely handled by "base" constraint in constr.c. Custom constraints no longer need to allocate this matrix.
* -Wall -Werror had no effect in Makefile.am and were moved to configure.ac. Now they work (requires autoconf-archive).
* Support for adding nonlinear constraints in Python and documentation.
* JSON network representation and parser with read/write capability.
* Base parser defaults to number of periods associated with data file and format-specific parsers are responsible for "propagating data on time".

* Elimination of obscure variables "voltage magnitude deviation".
* Elimination of obscure variables "voltage magnitude violation", "tap ratio deviation", "susceptance deviation".
